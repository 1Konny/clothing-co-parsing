## Description ##
Clothing Co-Parsing (CCP) dataset is a new shape database including elaborately annotated clothing items. It consists of 2, 098 high-resolution street fashion photos with huge human/clothing variations, which are in a wide range of styles, accessaries, garments, and pose. 1000 images of CCP are with superpixel-level annotations with totally 57 tags, and the rest of images are annotated with image-level tags. Compared with the existing shape databases, this database includes more realistic challenges, e.g., cluttered backgrounds, large intraclass variations, different poses/views, and self-occlusions, etc. (<a href='http://vision.sysu.edu.cn/projects/clothing-co-parsing/'>Project Page</a>)

## Examples ##
Some typical examples are illustrated in the following figure. Original photos (1st col), superpixels (2nd col), and annotations (3rd col and 4th col) are demonstrated.
